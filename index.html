                <p>Hi, Welcome to my personal website. <br><br> My name is <b>Manish Mathur</b>. I'm 19years old and currently a fresher student pursuing <b>BCA</b> as my choice of career, with plans to continue into <b>MCA</b> in future. Computers have been a big interest of mine for many years, especially the field of <b>Networking.</b> We all use the internet in our daily life, but the process behind it is often hidden that we never even think about how even as simple task of sending a message works on process level.<br><br>

My purpose of this website is to serve as my <b>digital portfolio and personal hub.</b> Intially, I planned on creating a notes dump location but updating notes digitially on daily basis is time consuming. Instead, this site will showcase my projects, interests, and useful resources as I grow in my academic and professional journey.
