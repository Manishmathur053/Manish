                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi, Welcome to my personal website. <br> My name is Manish Mathur, I'm 19years old and a fresher student. I'm persuing BCA as my choice of career and planning to do MCA in future. Computers has been a big interest of me for many years now. Especially the field of Networking, we use internet in our daily life but the process behind it is so hidden that we never even think about how even as simple task of sending a message works on process level.<br><br>

My plains for this website is to work as a digital portfolio + personal hub. Intially I was planning on creating this project as a notes dump location but updating notes digitially on daily basis is a waste of time. That is why this website will work as a digital portfolio and as a place to record my projects or good resources.
